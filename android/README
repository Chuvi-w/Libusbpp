Libusb++ for Android
====================

Building:
---------

To build Libusb++ for Android do the following:

 1. NDK requirements

    1.1. Download the latest NDK from:
         https://developer.android.com/ndk

    1.2. Extract the NDK.

    1.3. Open a shell and make sure there exist an NDK global variable
         set to the directory where you extracted the NDK.

         For example: export NDK="/opt/ndk-bundle"

 2. libusb requirements

    2.1. Clone or download the latest libusb source code from:
         https://github.com/libusb/libusb

    2.1. Extract the libusb archive when ZIP file was downloaded.

    2.2. Make sure there exists an LIBUSB global variable set to the
         directory where you extracted the libusb archive or cloned
         the repository.

         For example: export LIBUSB="/tmp/libusb"

 3. Change directory to usbutils's "android/jni"

 4. Run "$NDK/ndk-build".

The examples and the library can then be found in:
    "android/libs/$ARCH"

Where $ARCH is one of:
    armeabi
    armeabi-v7a
    mips
    mips64
    x86
    x86_64

Installing:
-----------

For a rooted device it is possible to install the artefacts into the data
area of a running device and set the execution permission and/or remount
the data area with the flags "rw,exec":

 1. Enable ADB on the device.

 2. Connect the device to a machine running ADB.

 3. Explore the ADB device list and looking for your running device:

    adb devices -l

 4. Make sure there exists an ADEV and ARCH global variable set to your
    running device and the right architecture (see list above), ex.:

    ADEV="0123456789ABCDEF"
    ARCH="armeabi-v7a"

 5. Make sure there exists an ADIR global variable set to the data area
    directory of your running device:

    ADIR="/data"

 6. Execute the following commands on the machine running ADB:

    # Create a sample directory
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell mkdir -p ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell ls -ald ${ADIR}/sample

    # Install usbutils
    adb -s ${ADEV} push -p ../libs/${ARCH} ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell ls -al ${ADIR}/sample
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell chmod 777 ${ADIR}/sample/usbpp-pic-example

    # Run examples in an interactive ADB shell
    adb -s ${ADEV} shell
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/sample /data/sample/usbpp-pic-example

For a non rooted device it is possible to install the artefacts onto the
sdcard area as shown above (with ADIR="/sdcard") but neither you will be
able to set execution permition or remount with "rw,exec" nor you have a
chance to execute the binaries. You will get an error message such like
this:

/system/bin/sh: /sdcard/usbpp-pic-example: can't execute: Permission denied

Runtime Permissions:
--------------------

The default system configuration on most Android device may cause
runtime permission errors. Read the corresponding section in the
libusb source code:
